Approach 2: Reverse Links in place (Iterative)
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode* prev = NULL ; 
        ListNode* temp = head ;


        while(temp != NULL)
        {
            ListNode* next = temp->next ;

            temp->next = prev; 
            prev = temp;
            temp = next;
        }
     return prev; 
    }
};

Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: O(N) The code traverses the entire linked list once, where 'n' is the number of nodes in the list. 
This traversal has a linear time complexity, O(n).

Space Complexity: O(1) The code uses only a constant amount of additional space, regardless of the linked list's length. 
This is achieved by using three pointers (prev, temp and front) to reverse the list without any significant extra memory usage, resulting in constant space complexity, O(1).
