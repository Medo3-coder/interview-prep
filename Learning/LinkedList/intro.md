Sure, let's go through each question with code examples in C++:

1. **What is a linked list?**
   A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes. Each node contains a data element and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence.

```cpp
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* next;
};
```

2. **Where is it used in coding and in real-life examples in software?**
   Linked lists are used in coding for implementing various data structures like stacks, queues, and hash tables. In software, they are used in scenarios where dynamic memory allocation is required, such as memory management systems and implementing file systems.

3. **What is a struct and class in C++ and Java and how to initialize them?**
   In C++, structs and classes are similar, except for the default access specifier (public for struct, private for class). In Java, there are only classes. Structs/classes can be initialized using constructors.

```cpp
// C++
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* next;
    Node(int d) : data(d), next(nullptr) {}
};

// Java
class Node {
    int data;
    Node next;
    Node(int d) {
        data = d;
        next = null;
    }
}
```

4. **What about the memory space used?**
   Linked lists use dynamic memory allocation, which means memory is allocated as needed. Each node occupies memory for data and a pointer to the next node.

5. **Difference between `Node` and `Node*`?**
   `Node` represents the actual node containing data and a pointer to the next node. `Node*` is a pointer to a node.

6. **How to convert an array to a linked list in C++?**
   You iterate through the array, creating a new node for each element and linking them together.

```cpp
Node* arrayToLinkedList(int arr[], int n) {
    Node* head = nullptr;
    Node* tail = nullptr;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        Node* newNode = new Node(arr[i]);
        if (!head) {
            head = newNode;
            tail = newNode;
        } else {
            tail->next = newNode;
            tail = newNode;
        }
    }
    return head;
}
```

7. **How to traverse a linked list?**
   You iterate through the list, starting from the head, and follow the `next` pointers until you reach the end.

```cpp
void traverseLinkedList(Node* head) {
    Node* current = head;
    while (current) {
        cout << current->data << " ";
        current = current->next;
    }
}
```

8. **How can you find the length of a linked list?**
   You iterate through the list, counting the number of nodes until you reach the end.

```cpp
int lengthOfLinkedList(Node* head) {
    int length = 0;
    Node* current = head;
    while (current) {
        length++;
        current = current->next;
    }
    return length;
}
```

These are basic implementations and concepts related to linked lists in C++
