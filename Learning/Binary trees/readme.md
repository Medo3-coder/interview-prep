Binary tree traversal refers to the process of visiting each node in a tree exactly once in a systematic way. There are several types of traversal methods:


# Introduction to Trees

A **tree** is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. It's widely used to represent hierarchical relationships.

## Key Terminologies

- **Node**: An element containing data and references to its child nodes.
- **Root**: The topmost node without a parent.
- **Edge**: A link connecting two nodes.
- **Parent**: A node that has one or more child nodes.
- **Child**: A node descended from another node.
- **Sibling**: Nodes sharing the same parent.
- **Leaf**: A node without children.
- **Internal Node**: A node with at least one child.
- **Degree**: The number of children a node has.
- **Level**: The distance from the root node.
- **Height**: The length of the longest path from a node to a leaf.
- **Depth**: The distance from the root to a node.
- **Path**: A sequence of nodes and edges connecting a node to a descendant.
- **Subtree**: A tree consisting of a node and its descendants.

## Types of Trees

- **General Tree**: No constraints on the number of children.
- **Binary Tree**: Each node has at most two children.
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary tree where the left child contains values less than the parent, and the right child contains values greater than the parent.
- **AVL Tree**: A self-balancing BST where the difference in heights between left and right subtrees is at most one.
- **Red-Black Tree**: A self-balancing BST with nodes colored red or black to ensure balance during insertions and deletions.
- **Splay Tree**: A self-adjusting BST that moves recently accessed elements to the root.
- **Treap**: A combination of a binary search tree and a heap, where each node has a key and a priority.

## Tree Traversal Methods

- **In-Order Traversal**: Traverse the left subtree, visit the root, then traverse the right subtree.
- **Pre-Order Traversal**: Visit the root, traverse the left subtree, then traverse the right subtree.
- **Post-Order Traversal**: Traverse the left subtree, traverse the right subtree, then visit the root.

Understanding these concepts is fundamental for working with hierarchical data structures and algorithms.

### **1. Depth-First Traversal (DFS)**  
DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It has three main types:

#### a. **In-order Traversal (Left, Root, Right)**  
- Visit the left subtree, then the root, and finally the right subtree.  
- Commonly used in Binary Search Trees (BSTs) to retrieve elements in sorted order.  
**Example:**  
For the tree:  
```
       1
      / \
     2   3
    / \
   4   5
```  
In-order traversal: `4, 2, 5, 1, 3`

---

#### b. **Pre-order Traversal (Root, Left, Right)**  
- Visit the root, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.  
- Used for creating a copy of the tree or for prefix expressions.  
**Example:**  
Pre-order traversal: `1, 2, 4, 5, 3`

---

#### c. **Post-order Traversal (Left, Right, Root)**  
- Visit the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the root.  
- Used for deleting the tree or for postfix expressions.  
**Example:**  
Post-order traversal: `4, 5, 2, 3, 1`

---

### **2. Breadth-First Traversal (BFS)**  
BFS visits all nodes at the current level before moving to the next level. It is also called **Level Order Traversal**.  
**Example:**  
For the same tree:  
```
       1
      / \
     2   3
    / \
   4   5
```  
Level order traversal: `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`

---

### **3. Boundary Traversal**  
- Traverses the boundary of the binary tree in an anti-clockwise direction.  
  - **Left Boundary**: Nodes on the left edge (excluding leaf nodes).  
  - **Leaves**: All leaf nodes from left to right.  
  - **Right Boundary**: Nodes on the right edge (excluding leaf nodes and root).  

---

### **4. Vertical Order Traversal**  
- Nodes are grouped and visited column-wise from leftmost to rightmost columns.  
- Commonly used in problems requiring vertical visualization of binary trees.

---

### **5. Spiral (Zigzag) Order Traversal**  
- Traverses the nodes level by level, but alternates the direction for each level.  
  - Level 1: Left to Right  
  - Level 2: Right to Left  

---

### **6. Morris Traversal**  
- A space-efficient traversal method that modifies the tree temporarily to achieve **in-order** traversal without using recursion or a stack.

### **Comparison of Traversals**  

| **Traversal Type**  | **Order**                  | **Use Case**                                  |
|----------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| In-order             | Left → Root → Right      | Sorted output for BSTs                       |
| Pre-order            | Root → Left → Right      | Tree copying, prefix expressions             |
| Post-order           | Left → Right → Root      | Tree deletion, postfix expressions           |
| Level-order          | Top level → Bottom level | BFS, shortest path in an unweighted tree     |
| Spiral-order         | Alternating directions   | Tree visualization in zigzag pattern         |

Binary trees are hierarchical data structures with various specialized forms based on constraints and applications. Below is a list of all major types of binary trees:

---

### **1. Full Binary Tree (Proper/Strict Binary Tree)**  
A binary tree is **full** if every node has either 0 or 2 children.  
**Example:**  
```
       1
      / \
     2   3
    / \  
   4   5
```

---

### **2. Complete Binary Tree**  
A binary tree is **complete** if all levels, except possibly the last, are completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible.  
**Example:**  
```
       1
      / \
     2   3
    / \  /
   4   5 6
```

---

### **3. Perfect Binary Tree**  
A binary tree is **perfect** if all internal nodes have two children and all leaf nodes are at the same level.  
**Example:**  
```
       1
      / \
     2   3
    / \ / \
   4  5 6  7
```

---

### **4. Balanced Binary Tree**  
A binary tree is **balanced** if the height of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most 1.  
**Example:**  
```
       1
      / \
     2   3
    / 
   4
```

---

### **5. Degenerate (or Pathological) Tree**  
A binary tree is **degenerate** if every parent node has only one child, forming a structure like a linked list.  
**Example:**  
```
   1
    \
     2
      \
       3
        \
         4
```

---

### **6. Binary Search Tree (BST)**  
A binary tree is a **BST** if for every node:
- All nodes in its left subtree have values smaller than the node.
- All nodes in its right subtree have values greater than the node.  
**Example:**  
```
       5
      / \
     3   7
    / \ / \
   2  4 6  8
```

---

### **7. AVL Tree**  
An **AVL tree** is a self-balancing binary search tree where the height difference between the left and right subtrees of any node is at most 1. Rotations are used to maintain balance.  

---

### **8. Red-Black Tree**  
A **Red-Black Tree** is a self-balancing BST with the following properties:
1. Each node is either red or black.
2. The root is always black.
3. Red nodes cannot have red children.
4. Every path from a node to its descendant leaf has the same number of black nodes.

---

### **9. Threaded Binary Tree**  
In a **threaded binary tree**, null pointers are replaced with references (or "threads") to the in-order predecessor or successor, facilitating in-order traversal without recursion or a stack.

---

### **10. Expression Tree**  
An **expression tree** represents an expression where:
- Internal nodes are operators.
- Leaf nodes are operands.  
**Example:**  
```
       +
      / \
     *   3
    / \
   2   1
```

---

### **11. Binary Heap**  
A **binary heap** is a complete binary tree used in heap-based algorithms:
- **Min-Heap:** The root is the smallest element.
- **Max-Heap:** The root is the largest element.  
**Example (Min-Heap):**  
```
       1
      / \
     3   6
    / \
   5   9
```

---

### **12. Huffman Tree**  
A **Huffman tree** is a binary tree used for optimal prefix codes in data compression. The structure depends on the frequency of characters.  

---

### **13. Skewed Binary Tree**  
A **skewed tree** is a degenerate tree where all nodes are skewed either:
- To the left: All nodes have only left children.
- To the right: All nodes have only right children.

---

### **14. Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree)**  
A **Fenwick tree** is a specialized data structure used for efficient computation of prefix sums and updates.

---
