Binary trees are hierarchical data structures with various specialized forms based on constraints and applications. Below is a list of all major types of binary trees:

---

### **1. Full Binary Tree (Proper/Strict Binary Tree)**  
A binary tree is **full** if every node has either 0 or 2 children.  
**Example:**  
```
       1
      / \
     2   3
    / \  
   4   5
```

---

### **2. Complete Binary Tree**  
A binary tree is **complete** if all levels, except possibly the last, are completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible.  
**Example:**  
```
       1
      / \
     2   3
    / \  /
   4   5 6
```

---

### **3. Perfect Binary Tree**  
A binary tree is **perfect** if all internal nodes have two children and all leaf nodes are at the same level.  
**Example:**  
```
       1
      / \
     2   3
    / \ / \
   4  5 6  7
```

---

### **4. Balanced Binary Tree**  
A binary tree is **balanced** if the height of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most 1.  
**Example:**  
```
       1
      / \
     2   3
    / 
   4
```

---

### **5. Degenerate (or Pathological) Tree**  
A binary tree is **degenerate** if every parent node has only one child, forming a structure like a linked list.  
**Example:**  
```
   1
    \
     2
      \
       3
        \
         4
```

---

### **6. Binary Search Tree (BST)**  
A binary tree is a **BST** if for every node:
- All nodes in its left subtree have values smaller than the node.
- All nodes in its right subtree have values greater than the node.  
**Example:**  
```
       5
      / \
     3   7
    / \ / \
   2  4 6  8
```

---

### **7. AVL Tree**  
An **AVL tree** is a self-balancing binary search tree where the height difference between the left and right subtrees of any node is at most 1. Rotations are used to maintain balance.  

---

### **8. Red-Black Tree**  
A **Red-Black Tree** is a self-balancing BST with the following properties:
1. Each node is either red or black.
2. The root is always black.
3. Red nodes cannot have red children.
4. Every path from a node to its descendant leaf has the same number of black nodes.

---

### **9. Threaded Binary Tree**  
In a **threaded binary tree**, null pointers are replaced with references (or "threads") to the in-order predecessor or successor, facilitating in-order traversal without recursion or a stack.

---

### **10. Expression Tree**  
An **expression tree** represents an expression where:
- Internal nodes are operators.
- Leaf nodes are operands.  
**Example:**  
```
       +
      / \
     *   3
    / \
   2   1
```

---

### **11. Binary Heap**  
A **binary heap** is a complete binary tree used in heap-based algorithms:
- **Min-Heap:** The root is the smallest element.
- **Max-Heap:** The root is the largest element.  
**Example (Min-Heap):**  
```
       1
      / \
     3   6
    / \
   5   9
```

---

### **12. Huffman Tree**  
A **Huffman tree** is a binary tree used for optimal prefix codes in data compression. The structure depends on the frequency of characters.  

---

### **13. Skewed Binary Tree**  
A **skewed tree** is a degenerate tree where all nodes are skewed either:
- To the left: All nodes have only left children.
- To the right: All nodes have only right children.

---

### **14. Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree)**  
A **Fenwick tree** is a specialized data structure used for efficient computation of prefix sums and updates.

These types are optimized for different use cases, from search and sorting to compression and expression evaluation. If you want a deep dive into any specific type, let me know!
