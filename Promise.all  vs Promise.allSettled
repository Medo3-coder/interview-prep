Both `Promise.all` and `Promise.allSettled` are used to handle multiple promises concurrently, but they behave differently when one or more promises in the list are rejected. Here's a detailed comparison:

---

### **1. `Promise.all`**

- **Behavior:**
  - Resolves when **all promises in the array succeed (resolve)**.
  - Rejects **immediately if any promise fails (rejects)**.
  - If it rejects, the rejection reason is the reason of the first promise that fails.

- **Use Case:**
  - Use `Promise.all` when you want to stop execution if any promise fails.
  - Ideal when all promises are **interdependent** or you cannot proceed unless all succeed.

- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  Promise.all([
    Promise.resolve("Success 1"),
    Promise.resolve("Success 2"),
    Promise.reject("Error"),
  ])
    .then((results) => {
      console.log("All promises resolved:", results);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      console.log("Promise rejected:", error); // Logs "Error"
    });
  ```

  - Output: 
    ```
    Promise rejected: Error
    ```

---

### **2. `Promise.allSettled`**

- **Behavior:**
  - Waits for **all promises to settle**, regardless of whether they succeed (resolve) or fail (reject).
  - Returns an array with the **status** (`fulfilled` or `rejected`) and corresponding **value** or **reason** for each promise.
  - Does not short-circuit when a promise fails.

- **Use Case:**
  - Use `Promise.allSettled` when you want to handle the **results of all promises** individually, regardless of their success or failure.
  - Ideal when promises are **independent** and partial results are acceptable.

- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  Promise.allSettled([
    Promise.resolve("Success 1"),
    Promise.resolve("Success 2"),
    Promise.reject("Error"),
  ])
    .then((results) => {
      console.log("All promises settled:", results);
    });
  ```

  - Output:
    ```
    All promises settled: [
      { status: "fulfilled", value: "Success 1" },
      { status: "fulfilled", value: "Success 2" },
      { status: "rejected", reason: "Error" }
    ]
    ```

### **Key Differences**

| Feature                | `Promise.all`                              | `Promise.allSettled`                     |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Execution Behavior** | Stops at the first rejected promise.       | Waits for all promises to settle.        |
| **Returns**            | Single result array (all resolved values). | Array with `status` and `value/reason`.  |
| **Rejection**          | Rejects immediately if any promise fails. | Never rejects; handles all results.      |
| **Use Case**           | When all promises must succeed.            | When handling all results is required.   |

---

### **Choosing Between Them**

- **Use `Promise.all` if:**
  - All promises must resolve for your program to continue.
  - Failure of one promise makes the entire operation meaningless.

- **Use `Promise.allSettled` if:**
  - You need to handle each promise independently.
  - Partial success is acceptable or needed for further processing.

### **Real-World Analogy**

Imagine you're ordering food from multiple restaurants using delivery apps:

- **`Promise.all`:**
  - If one restaurant cancels your order, you cancel all other orders because you want to eat everything together.
  - One failure stops the entire operation.

- **`Promise.allSettled`:**
  - Even if one restaurant cancels your order, you accept the deliveries from others and make do with what you have.
  - Partial success is acceptable.
