Both `Promise.all` and `Promise.allSettled` are used to handle multiple promises concurrently, but they behave differently when one or more promises in the list are rejected. Here's a detailed comparison:

---

### **1. `Promise.all`**

- **Behavior:**
  - Resolves when **all promises in the array succeed (resolve)**.
  - Rejects **immediately if any promise fails (rejects)**.
  - If it rejects, the rejection reason is the reason of the first promise that fails.

- **Use Case:**
  - Use `Promise.all` when you want to stop execution if any promise fails.
  - Ideal when all promises are **interdependent** or you cannot proceed unless all succeed.

- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  Promise.all([
    Promise.resolve("Success 1"),
    Promise.resolve("Success 2"),
    Promise.reject("Error"),
  ])
    .then((results) => {
      console.log("All promises resolved:", results);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      console.log("Promise rejected:", error); // Logs "Error"
    });
  ```

  - Output: 
    ```
    Promise rejected: Error
    ```

---

### **2. `Promise.allSettled`**

- **Behavior:**
  - Waits for **all promises to settle**, regardless of whether they succeed (resolve) or fail (reject).
  - Returns an array with the **status** (`fulfilled` or `rejected`) and corresponding **value** or **reason** for each promise.
  - Does not short-circuit when a promise fails.

- **Use Case:**
  - Use `Promise.allSettled` when you want to handle the **results of all promises** individually, regardless of their success or failure.
  - Ideal when promises are **independent** and partial results are acceptable.

- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  Promise.allSettled([
    Promise.resolve("Success 1"),
    Promise.resolve("Success 2"),
    Promise.reject("Error"),
  ])
    .then((results) => {
      console.log("All promises settled:", results);
    });
  ```

  - Output:
    ```
    All promises settled: [
      { status: "fulfilled", value: "Success 1" },
      { status: "fulfilled", value: "Success 2" },
      { status: "rejected", reason: "Error" }
    ]
    ```

### **Key Differences**

| Feature                | `Promise.all`                              | `Promise.allSettled`                     |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Execution Behavior** | Stops at the first rejected promise.       | Waits for all promises to settle.        |
| **Returns**            | Single result array (all resolved values). | Array with `status` and `value/reason`.  |
| **Rejection**          | Rejects immediately if any promise fails. | Never rejects; handles all results.      |
| **Use Case**           | When all promises must succeed.            | When handling all results is required.   |

---

### **Choosing Between Them**

- **Use `Promise.all` if:**
  - All promises must resolve for your program to continue.
  - Failure of one promise makes the entire operation meaningless.

- **Use `Promise.allSettled` if:**
  - You need to handle each promise independently.
  - Partial success is acceptable or needed for further processing.

---

### **Real-World Analogy**

Imagine you're ordering food from multiple restaurants using delivery apps:

- **`Promise.all`:**
  - If one restaurant cancels your order, you cancel all other orders because you want to eat everything together.
  - One failure stops the entire operation.

- **`Promise.allSettled`:**
  - Even if one restaurant cancels your order, you accept the deliveries from others and make do with what you have.
  - Partial success is acceptable.


***********************************************************************
The `Promise.allSettled()` function is used to handle multiple asynchronous tasks concurrently and ensures that you can handle the result of all of them once they've completed, regardless of whether they resolve or reject. Here's how and why we use it:

### Why use `Promise.allSettled()`?
- **Parallel Requests**: When you want to make multiple API requests or asynchronous operations and handle their results in parallel, `Promise.allSettled()` is useful.
- **Non-blocking Execution**: It allows both requests (like fetching categories and sliders in your case) to run simultaneously, without waiting for one to complete before starting the other. This can improve performance, especially if the two requests are independent of each other.
- **Complete Handling**: It allows you to handle both success and failure for each individual promise. While `Promise.all()` will reject immediately if one promise fails, `Promise.allSettled()` will always return a result for all promises (either fulfilled or rejected), making it safer to use when you need to handle both success and failure cases.

### How `Promise.allSettled()` Works:
`Promise.allSettled()` returns an array of objects, each object representing the result of a promise that was settled (either fulfilled or rejected). Each object has:
- **`status`**: Can be either `"fulfilled"` or `"rejected"`.
- **`value`** (if fulfilled): The result of the promise.
- **`reason`** (if rejected): The error that caused the rejection.

### Example of your code:

```javascript
const [menuResponse, sliderResponse] = await Promise.allSettled([
  axios.get(AppURL.CategoryDetails),
  axios.get(AppURL.Sliders),
]);

// Handle menu response
if (menuResponse.status === "fulfilled") {
  setMenuData(menuResponse.value.data.categories);
} else {
  ToastMessages.showError("Failed to load categories");
}

// Handle slider response
if (sliderResponse.status === "fulfilled") {
  setSliderData(sliderResponse.value.data.sliders);
} else {
  ToastMessages.showError("Failed to load sliders");
}
```

- **`menuResponse`**: This is the result of the request to fetch the categories. If the request is successful, `menuResponse.status` will be `"fulfilled"`, and you can access the categories data via `menuResponse.value.data.categories`.
  
- **`sliderResponse`**: This is the result of the request to fetch the sliders. Similarly, if it's successful, `sliderResponse.status` will be `"fulfilled"`, and you can access the sliders via `sliderResponse.value.data.sliders`.

### Why you find a `value` in `response`:
When the promise is fulfilled, the response will contain the `value` property, which holds the resolved data. For example, in the case of Axios, the response is an object with properties like `data`, `status`, and `headers`. Therefore, when the request succeeds, you access the data using `response.value.data`. 

This is different from a rejected promise, where you would access the `reason` property to get the error message or object that caused the rejection.

### Summary:
- `Promise.allSettled()` helps you handle multiple promises in parallel and manage both success and failure cases.
- The response object for each promise contains `status`, `value` (in case of success), or `reason` (in case of failure), which allows you to handle each scenario appropriately.
